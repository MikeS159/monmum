Monitoring Mum

Tele-caring with the Internet of Things, Open Source and Open Hardware

People are living longer than ever before, and the pattern of retirement is
now more likely to be a period of good health followed by a gradual decline
over several years rather than sudden death from heart attack. This means
that there is a gradual shift from fully-independent living through
lightly-supported living and possibly ending with full-time care.
Most of the early support comes from family, friends and neighbours.
This can be quite difficult for widely-spread families and there can be
pressure on the older people to move out of their homes purely because
the caring family is worried about their ability to live alone safely.

Remote monitoring can give confidence to remote carers that the older
person is still coping: moving around the house, cooking, taking baths,
and keeping warm. The challenge is to do this without intruding too much
into the life and privacy of the person being monitored, and yet to
raise an alarm when necessary.

This talk will describe an Internet-of-Things approach to monitoring,
using readily-available components. Sensors measure light, temperature
and movement, which they report via message queues. The system is
designed to allow either a cloud-based logging and alerting service
or a completely private infrastructure. Hardware and software designs
will be openly available, giving confidence that personal data can be
properly controlled.
