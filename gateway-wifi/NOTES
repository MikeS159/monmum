Using GL-AR150M micro router running OpenWRT as gateway for Monmum roomnodes

Current firmware 2.22 - could update to 2.25
BEWARE! Firmware update de-installs mosquitto and loses most of the config files.

Set SSID, password (PSK), channel, and IP address
Set admin password
If connecting from WAN side, also need to note down serial number

Use SSH as root for non-GUI tasks

Could consider blocking NAT from WiFi to WAN, to further protect nodes.

If you don't have IPv6:
Need to disable IPv6 DHCP on LAN side to avoid logging loop complaining about
a lack of globally routable prefixes on that net:
	Network->Interfaces
	Edit LAN
	DHCP Server->IPv6 Settings
	Set all DHCP v6 options to 'disabled'
	Click 'Save and apply'

Installed mosquitto v1.4.4-1 (latest is 1.4.10)
Package does not include mosquitto_passwd so run that elsewhere to create file
and paste into /etc/mosquitto/passwd

Create user and group for mosquitto - uid 1883 gid 1883 - by editing files in /etc

Install config file and X509 CA Certificate for mosquitto

Add these lines to /etc/sysupgrade.conf to preserve config at upgrade time:
/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
/etc/mosquitto/passwd
/etc/mosquitto/ca.cert


If planning to monitor MQTT messages locally, use the advanced config page
under Network-Firewall to add a traffic rule:
	Name: mosquitto
	Proto: TCP
	External port: 1883
Click Add, then Save+Apply

Similarly for SSH:
	Name: External SSH
	Proto: TCP
	External port: 22
Click Add, then Save+Apply

To test:
	mosquitto_sub -v -h <IP addr> -u <user> -P <password> -t '#'
