Ideas for alerting rules
========================

Many of these rules only work if there is just one person in the house...

HouseOccupiedNow:
	Two or more movement sensor 'on' events in the past hour

HouseOccupiedToday:
	HouseOccupiedNow has been true at least once since 0400

HouseOccupiedOvernight:
	Time now is between 0400 and 23:30
	and
	HouseOccupiedNow was true at some time between 2100 (previous day) and 0400 today

NoMovement:
	HouseOccupiedNow has not been true at any time in the past 18 hours

InBedroom:
	Bedroom movement sensor has triggered more recently than any others

InBathroom:
	Bathroom movement sensor has triggered more recently than any others (needs a hallway sensor)
	Alternative: Bathroom movement sensor has triggered within the past 5 minutes

SatUpAllNight:
	Time now is between 0600 and 2330
	and
	InBedroom was false at 0400

StuckInBedroom:
	InBedroom is true and no other sensor has triggered for 14 hours

StuckInBathroom:
	Bathroom movement sensor has triggered more recently than any others (needs a hallway sensor)
	and
	No other internal movement sensor has triggered in the past hour
	


TooHot:
	Any temperature sensor reading above 28C

TooCold:
	InBedroom is true and bedroom temp below 16C
	or
	HouseOccupiedNow is true and InBedroom is false and living-room temp is below 20C

Hypothermia:
	HouseOccupiedNow is true and living-room temp is below 16C

FrostRisk:
	Any internal temp below 8C (heating is supposed to hold living room above 10C at all times)

FreezeDamageImminent:
	Any internal temp below 3C
